## How to use this bot:

To work with the default bot.clj, ensure you have [leiningen](github.com/technomancy/leiningen) up and working and do the following:

    $ lein deps
    $ lein uberjar
    > ... 
    > cljbot.jar 
    
    $ java -jar tools/PlayGame.jar maps/map7.txt 3000 1000 log.txt "java -jar example_bots/RandomBot.jar" "java -hotspot -jar cljbot.jar" | java -jar tools/ShowGame.jar

And you should be good to go.

## Notes

Note that the start-up time is 3000ms instead of 1000; this is because
it takes about that long for the JVM to get going with Clojure. If the
bot times out, there's a chance you'll need to increase the time. 

Hopefully there will be an update to the game engine that doesn't penalize slow start-up times (e.g. both bots send "OKAY" when they're all ready, *then* recieve the map/game-state from the game engine.)
